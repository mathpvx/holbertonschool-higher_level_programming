# SQL - More Queries

Welcome to the SQL - More Queries project! In this project, we'll explore various SQL concepts and techniques for managing users, privileges, and database tables in MySQL.

## Concepts

We'll cover the following SQL concepts in this project:
- Creating a new MySQL user
- Managing privileges for users
- Understanding PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints
- Using NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
- Retrieving data from multiple tables with JOIN and UNION
- Understanding subqueries

## Tasks Examples

### 0. My privileges!
- Write a script that lists all privileges of the MySQL users user_0d_1 and user_0d_2 on your server (in localhost).

### 5. Unique ID
- Write a script that creates the table unique_id on your MySQL server.
  - The table should have columns `id` (INT with default value 1 and unique) and `name` (VARCHAR(256)).
  - The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command.
  - If the table `unique_id` already exists, your script should not fail.
