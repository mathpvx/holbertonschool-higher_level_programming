# Python - import & modules

## Description
This project focuses on understanding how to import functions from other Python files, create modules, and utilize command-line arguments with Python programs. It covers the basics of module creation, importing functions, using command-line arguments, and preventing code execution when imported.

## Concepts
- Importing Functions: Understanding how to import functions from other Python files using the `import` statement.
- Creating Modules: Learning how to create Python modules by organizing related functions and classes into separate files.
- Command-Line Arguments: Understanding how to use command-line arguments with Python programs to customize behavior.
- Preventing Code Execution: Knowing how to prevent code execution when a module is imported using the `__name__` attribute.
- Using `dir()`: Familiarizing with the built-in `dir()` function to list the names defined by a module.

## Tasks Examples
### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
Write a Python program that imports the `add()` function from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of adding 1 and 2.

### 4. Who are you?
Write a Python program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`, excluding those starting with "__".
