# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
This project focuses on understanding sets, dictionaries, and lambda functions in Python. It covers common methods and operations for sets and dictionaries, as well as when to use them compared to lists. Additionally, it introduces lambda functions and the map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Concepts
- Sets: Understanding sets and their common methods in Python, including when to use sets versus lists.
- Dictionaries: Understanding dictionaries as key-value pairs and their common methods and operations, including iterating over dictionaries.
- Lambda Functions: Understanding lambda functions as anonymous functions used for small tasks, particularly with map, reduce, and filter functions.
- Map, Reduce, Filter: Understanding map, reduce, and filter functions as higher-order functions to apply functions to iterables or to filter elements based on a condition.

## Tasks
### 0. Squared simple
Write a Python function that computes the square value of all integers in a given matrix.

### 4. Only differents
Write a Python function that returns a set of all elements present in only one of two given sets.
