# Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This project focuses on understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It covers the fundamentals of classes and objects, attributes, methods, and encapsulation. Additionally, it explains the Pythonic way of writing getters and setters, as well as the usage of properties.

## Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding the principles of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
- Class: Learning how to define classes in Python to create objects with specific attributes and behaviors.
- Encapsulation: Understanding the concept of encapsulation and how it allows controlling access to class attributes.
- Properties vs. Getters and Setters: Understanding the difference between properties, getters, and setters in Python.
- Special Methods: Learning about special methods like `__init__` and how they are used in Python classes.
- Documentation: Writing meaningful documentation (docstrings) for modules, classes, and functions according to the Google Style Python Docstrings.

## Tasks
