## Description
This project focuses on understanding and handling exceptions in Python. It covers the difference between errors and exceptions, how to use exceptions, and the purpose of catching exceptions. Additionally, it explains when to implement a clean-up action after an exception.

## Concepts
- Errors vs Exceptions: Understanding the difference between errors and exceptions in Python.
- Exceptions Handling: Learning how to correctly handle exceptions using try-except blocks.
- Raising Exceptions: Knowing how to raise built-in exceptions in Python code.
- Clean-up Actions: Understanding the purpose of implementing clean-up actions after an exception using try-except-finally blocks.

## Tasks
### 0. Safe list printing
Write a Python function that prints a specified number of elements from a list, handling any possible exceptions.

### 4. Divide a list
Write a Python function that divides two lists element-wise and handles various exceptions, such as division by zero and wrong types of elements.
