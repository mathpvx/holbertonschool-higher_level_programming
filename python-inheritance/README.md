# Python - Inheritance

## Description
This Holberton School project is about inheritance in Python, including superclass, subclass, method overriding, multiple inheritance, and the purpose of inheritance. It covers how to inherit classes from one another, override methods or attributes inherited from base classes.

## Concepts
- Superclass, Subclass, and Inheritance: Understanding the relationships between superclass, subclass, and inheritance.
- Method and Attribute Inheritance: Learning which attributes or methods are available to subclasses by inheritance.
- Method Overriding: Understanding how to override methods or attributes inherited from the base class.
- Multiple Inheritance: Learning how to define a class with multiple base classes.
- Built-in Functions: Understanding how to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions.

## Tasks
### 0. Lookup
Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

### 3. Same class or inherit from
Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise False.
