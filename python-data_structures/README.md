# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This project focuses on understanding lists and tuples in Python, including their common methods, differences, and similarities. It covers list comprehensions, using lists as stacks and queues, tuple packing and unpacking, sequence operations, and the `del` statement.

## Concepts
- Lists: Understanding how to create, access, and manipulate lists in Python, including common methods and operations.
- Tuples: Understanding tuples as immutable sequences in Python and when to use them compared to lists.
- Sequence Operations: Knowing sequence operations such as indexing, slicing, concatenation, and repetition for both lists and tuples.
- List Comprehensions: Understanding list comprehensions as a concise way to create lists in Python.
- Stack and Queue: Understanding how to use lists as stacks and queues for Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO) operations.
- Tuple Packing and Unpacking: Understanding tuple packing and unpacking, and their applications in Python.
- `del` Statement: Understanding the `del` statement for removing elements from lists or deleting entire variables.

## Tasks
### 0. Print a list of integers
Write a Python function that prints all integers of a given list, one integer per line.

### 9. Find the max
Write a Python function that finds the biggest integer in a given list.
