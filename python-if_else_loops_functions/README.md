# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description
This project focuses on learning control flow tools in Python, including if/else statements, loops (while and for), and functions. It covers the importance of indentation, using comments, variable assignment, and understanding scope of variables. Additionally, it introduces basic arithmetic operators and their usage in Python.

## Concepts
- Importance of Indentation: Understanding why indentation is crucial in Python for defining blocks of code.
- Control Flow Tools: Learning how to use if/else statements, while and for loops, break and continue statements, and else clauses on loops.
- Pass Statement: Understanding the purpose of the pass statement and when to use it.
- Functions: What is a function, how to define and call functions, and how to return values from functions.
- Scope of Variables: Understanding variable scope in Python and how it affects access to variables.
- Arithmetic Operators: Familiarizing with basic arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, %, and their usage.
- Comments: Learning how to write comments in Python to document code.

## Tasks
### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
Complete the source code to print whether the random signed number stored in the variable `number` is positive, negative, or zero.

### 10. a + b
Write a function `add(a, b)` that adds two integers `a` and `b` and returns the result.
