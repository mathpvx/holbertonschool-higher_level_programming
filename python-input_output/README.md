# Python - Input/Output

## Description
This project focuses on working with input/output operations in Python, including reading and writing files, handling JSON data, and accessing command line parameters. It covers topics such as file manipulation, serialization, deserialization, and command line parameter access.

## Concepts
- Reading and Writing Files: Understanding how to open, read, and write text files in Python.
- File Operations: Learning how to read the full content of a file, read a file line by line, and move the cursor in a file.
- File Handling: Ensuring proper file closure after usage and utilizing the `with` statement for file operations.
- JSON Serialization and Deserialization: Understanding JSON format, serialization, and deserialization of Python data structures.
- Command Line Parameters: Accessing command line parameters in a Python script.

## Tasks
### 0. Read file
Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints its content to stdout.

### 3. To JSON string
Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
