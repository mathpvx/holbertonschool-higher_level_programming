# Python - Everything is object

## Description
This project delves into Python's object-oriented nature and explores the concepts of mutability, immutability, references, assignments, aliases, and object identity. It emphasizes understanding the differences between mutable and immutable objects and how Python handles variables and object references.

## Concepts
- Objects: Understanding the fundamental concept of objects in Python.
- Classes and Instances: Differentiating between classes and instances (objects) in Python.
- Immutable vs. Mutable Objects: Recognizing the distinction between immutable and mutable objects and their implications.
- References and Aliases: Understanding how variables in Python are references to objects and the concept of aliases.
- Object Identity: Learning about object identity and how to determine if two variables are linked to the same object.
- Built-in Mutable and Immutable Types: Identifying the built-in mutable and immutable data types in Python.
- Variable Passing: Understanding how Python passes variables to functions.

## Task Example

### 12. And with a list, is it really equal
What do these 3 lines print?
```
>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = l1
>>> print(l1 == l2)
``` 

## Testing
- All answers should be provided in a .txt file with one line per answer.
- No shebang is required in the .txt files.
- All .txt files should end with a new line.
